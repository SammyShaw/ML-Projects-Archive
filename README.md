# Machine Learning Projects Archive

This repository serves as an archive of three supervised and unsupervised machine learning projects completed during the Data Science Infinity program.  
Each project demonstrates end-to-end implementation ‚Äî from data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and business application ‚Äî using Python and scikit-learn.

These projects collectively showcase a range of core data science skills:
- Regression modeling and prediction
- Supervised classification and evaluation metrics
- Unsupervised clustering and customer segmentation
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model interpretability

## Project Summaries

### 1. Predicting Customer Loyalty (Regression)
**Goal:** Build predictive regression models to estimate customer loyalty scores for ABC Grocery‚Äôs membership program.  
**Techniques:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Feature Selection via RFECV.  
**Highlights:**  
- Compared multiple regression approaches for predictive accuracy.  
- Identified key drivers of customer loyalty such as spending patterns and distance from store.  
- Demonstrated robust data preprocessing and feature importance analysis.

### 2. Enhancing Targeting Accuracy (Classification)
**Goal:** Predict which customers are most likely to sign up for ABC Grocery‚Äôs *Delivery Club* membership using supervised ML classification.  
**Techniques:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).  
**Highlights:**  
- Random Forest achieved the best balance of accuracy (0.935) and recall (0.904).  
- Emphasized interpretability via feature and permutation importance.  
- Provided actionable business insight: proximity to store was the top predictor of signups.

### 3. "You Are What You Eat" Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
**Goal:** Use unsupervised learning (k-means) to segment grocery customers based on dietary preferences and spending patterns.  
**Techniques:** K-Means Clustering, Feature Scaling, WCSS (Elbow Method).  
**Highlights:**  
- Identified 3 main segments (General, Vegetarian, Vegan-like) based on product area spend.  
- Provided clear actionable insights for personalized marketing strategies.  
- Suggested future applications: deeper subcategory segmentation, integration with demographic data.
